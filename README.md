The goal of this analysis is to build a classifier algorith that predicts if a performed physical excercise was done correctly or not and if not in what consisted the error. Classification is build using the data from accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell as well as responce variables: classes A, B, C, D and E, class A corresponding to a correct execution of the exercise, and the remaining ones to common mistakes.  
  
--> The data comes from here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 
--> inalProject.Rmd contains analysis steps together with the code used for its implementation and comments on the results.
